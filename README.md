# **BookWiki** 

This is my first full-stack project.
I chose to make a website that is like GoodReads. You can get information about the books and the authors that I put. You can see what are the books that an author has wrote and you can also go the other way around and see which author did which book.

## CRUD
With this project I learnt all the basic crud operations connected to the local database so now i can add, update and delete.

> [!Caution]
> To be able to launch this program you will need the bookwiki-fe and bookwiki-be which are both available in my [github account](https://github.com/Hares-2088)

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
